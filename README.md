# JS Tutor

Hello there! In this repo you'll be tested on a wide range of JavaScript concepts, to get started follow the instructions below:

1. Fork this repository to your own account
2. Clone the repo down to your system
3. Open the repo in VSCode
4. Right click the js-tutor folder, and select Open in Integrated Terminal
5. Type `cd 00` in the terminal and press tab, that will auto-complete and take you into the folder 00 Intro

From there, simply follow the list down to completion. To test your work you need to enter the following command for each file: 

`node 00returnString.js`
</br>

`node 01convertNum.js`

You can use the auto-complete for this as well by typing `node 00`, `node 01` etc then pressing tab. 

Additionally, inside of 00 Intro there is a solutions file. Before looking at the solutions spend an *hour* - *a full hour* - trying to solve it alone using things like Google, StackOverflow, Discord communities, etc. It'll be frustrating when you get stuck, but it's all part of the process of improving

Remember to star and watch the project on GitHub, as new problems and solutions will be added constantly
